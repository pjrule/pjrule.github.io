Inspired by previous work in <a href="http://www.culturomics.org/" target="_blank">culturomics</a>, a branch of the digital humanities that uses large datasets to study broad trends in language usage, I analyzed <em>word trajectories</em>: do words or phrases ever really go out of fashion? (The answer: rarely.)
