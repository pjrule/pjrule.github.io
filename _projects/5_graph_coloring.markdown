For my final project in <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~aloupis/comp150/" target="_blank">Topics on Algorithms, Graphs, and Data Structures</a> (Tufts COMP150-ALG), I <a href="https://pjrule.me/comp150-alg/">surveyed the literature for the graph coloring problem</a>, a notoriously inapproximable NP-complete problem. I also implemented React-based animations of several popular coloring heuristics and explored the properties of Erdős–Rényi random graphs.
