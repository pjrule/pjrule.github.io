In collaboration with <a href="https://bhushansuwal.com/about.html" target="_blank">Bhushan Suwal</a> (MGGG) and <a href="https://sunnymatt.com/" target="_blank">Matthew Sun</a> (Princeton), I am developing an optimized, parallelized version of MGGG's <a href="https://github.com/mggg/gerrychain" target="_blank">GerryChain</a>, a popular tool for generating redistricting plans via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. This new tool is forty times faster than GerryChain in typical single-core cases and has significantly accelerated some of MGGG's key experimental workflows.
