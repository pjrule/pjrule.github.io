title: Queueing for campus coronavirus testing
description: An interactive featuring a parameterized simulation of the M/D/c queue model tailored to the university context. It informed logistical planning at several schools in the NESCAC consortium in summer 2020.

At MGGG, I developed an interactive tool for modeling wait times at coronavirus testing centers on university campuses. This interactive was used by administrators at multiple NESCAC schools to plan the fall 2020 semester. The underlying model is a time-dependent variant of the M/D/c queue, a fundamental model in queueing theory. I built the user interface with <a href="https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/" target="_blank">Victory</a> and React.
