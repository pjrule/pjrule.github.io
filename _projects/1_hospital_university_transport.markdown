In collaboration with my colleagues at MGGG, I designed data pipelines and a mixed integer programming-based algorithm for a COVID-era logistics problem: what is the best way to use empty college dormitories as overflow space for strained hospitals? 

Our model is available as <a href="https://mggg.org/covid-flows/index.html" target="_blank">an interactive</a> and a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/mggg/covid-analysis/blob/master/University-hospital%20bed%20assignment.ipynb" target="_blank">Google Colab notebook</a>.
