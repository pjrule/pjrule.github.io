Drawing congressional districts is largely about striking compromises between complex political and geographic interests. I sought to simulate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting_commission" target="_blank">citizens' commission</a> by training virtual agents to competitively draw maps according to their own interests using <a href="https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/" target="_blank">evolution strategies</a> (a variant of reinforcement learning). 

For this work, I was awarded an <a href="https://aigrant.org/" target="_blank">AI Grant</a> that included $20,000 of Google Cloud Platform credits and $2,500 of direct funding in my senior year of high school.
