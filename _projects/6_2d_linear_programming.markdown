For my final project in <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/163/">Computational Geometry</a> (Tufts COMP163), I implemented Joseph Megiddo's seminal algorithm for solving 2D linear programs in linear time, along with several other fundamental algorithms in computational geometry. The project is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/pjrule/comp163-project/blob/master/Low-dimensional%20linear%20programming.ipynb" target="_blank">available as a Google Colab notebook</a>.
