My final project team for Mathematical Modeling and Computation (Tufts MATH87) studied grid idealizations of a search-and-rescue problem inspired by a team member's professional work with El Paso County Search & Rescue. Our approach utilized finite-horizon methods to coordinate a simulated search party over a series of timesteps.
