I am an undergraduate at Tufts University, where I study mathematics, computer science, and <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/sts/" target="_blank">STS</a> (science, technology, and society). I work as a software engineer and research associate at <a href="https://mggg.org/" target="_blank">**MGGG Redistricting Lab**</a>, a research group within Tufts' <a href="https://tischcollege.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">Tisch College of Civic Life</a> led by <a href="https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/" target="_blank">Moon Duchin</a>. At the lab, I work on a range of problems in scientific computing and operations research. My recent projects include

* <a href="https://github.com/mggg/covid-scheduling" target="_blank">**A model used to schedule COVID-19 tests for the Tufts population.**</a>
* <a href="https://mggg.org/covid-flows/index.html" target="_blank">**A model for allocating unused dormitory beds to strained hospitals**.</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/mggg/gerrychainjulia" target="_blank">**GerryChain.jl**</a>, a high-performance Julia library for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of redistricting plans.
* <a href="https://mggg.github.io/covid-queueing/" target="_blank">**An interactive tool based on queueing theory**</a> used by university administrators to design COVID-19 testing centers.

I am also affiliated with Tufts' <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/research/geometry/index.php" target="_blank">Computational Geometry research group</a>, where I have recently studied motion planning algorithms for disinfection robots.
