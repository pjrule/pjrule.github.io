  abstract={We define a distance metric between partitions of a graph using machinery from optimal transport. Our metric is built from a linear assignment problem that matches partition components, with assignment cost proportional to transport distance over graph edges. We show that our distance can be computed using a single linear program without precomputing pairwise assignment costs and derive several theoretical properties of the metric. Finally, we provide experiments demonstrating these properties empirically, specifically focusing on the metric's value for new problems in ensemble-based analysis of political districting plans.},

  abstract={Regular irradiation of indoor environments with ultraviolet C (UVC) light has become a regular task for many indoor settings as a result of COVID-19, but current robotic systems attempting to automate it suffer from high costs and inefficient irradiation. In this paper, we propose a purpose-made inexpensive robotic platform with off-the-shelf components and standard navigation software that, with a novel algorithm for finding optimal irradiation locations, addresses both shortcomings to offer affordable and efficient solutions for UVC irradiation. We demonstrate in simulations the efficacy of the algorithm and show a prototypical run of the autonomous integrated robotic system in an indoor environment. In our sample instances, our proposed algorithm reduces the time needed by roughly 30% while it increases the coverage by a factor of 35% (when compared to the best possible placement of a static light).},
